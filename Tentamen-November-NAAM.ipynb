    "# Welcome to this exam for data analysis in Python\n",
    "Over the last few weeks, you've indulged yourselves with Python, probably sometimes with a bit of frustration. Fortunately, it has been shown that frustration leads to new learnings and hopefully you've gained some beautiful skills. This exam aims at testing these newly acquired skills and consists of 2 *mandatory* sections and 1 optional. The first section contains some random python questions and focusses at testing your basic python skills. The 2nd and optional third section aim at testing your skills to work on an actual business problem that requires monthly action and therefor we want to create a piece of code that we can simply run monthly, with the third section being a though cookie and definitely requiring you to use the internet to solve it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to this exam is all up to you! You're free to call each other, me, use the internet, hire a freelancer, do it within 30 minutes, or take 5 hours to solve it. It's all up to you. The questions are relatively easily google'able, as long as you understand the problem properly! also, don't forget, there is no correct/wrong approach to a problem! All I need you to do is show me that you understand how to tackle a problem. Keep in mind to save your notebook frequently!\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam was designed to take approximately 45-60 minutes (the first two compulsory sections (verplicht)) and the opotional third section shall take another 15. And I know I've been hard on you with some chapters, but I promise to not break your heart (during this exam) and am truly confident that you can succesfully complete it yourself or with the help of the internet! Best of luck! \n"

    "\n",
    "Every month, Robin has to manually manipulate and merge two dataframes into one, to be loaded into the air ambulance's navigation software. These data sources originate from the Rijksoverheid, and are 100's of Megabytes in size, but has been reduced to approx. 175mb in an excel format for this exam. One of the files in a so-called .dbf format, which is a specific database format and the second (adapted) file is in excel. I will help you import the .dbf file as we need to work with a new package to open this type. Hopefully by now, you know that you can use plenty of file types in python! In this case, you will combine the .dfb and excel file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, by default, the helicopter's navigation can only navigate to normal streets, using a streetname. However, as you may know, many accidents occur at the highways. In order for the navigation to work properly, we need to add the location of every section of highway (wegvakken) in The Netherlands which enables it to navigate to all the dutch motorways. The locations of these highway sections (wegvakken) is specified by a *hectometerpaaltje*. Hence, our first data set contains all the highway sections and hectometerpaaltjes, so the helicopter knows where to go. But, just flying somewhere won't enable MAA to assist, they also need to land safely. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, our second data set contains information on the width of the highways at the location of every 'wegvak' in the netherlands. The EC-135 type of helicopter that MAA uses, has a wingspan of 10.20 meters, but for safety, it requires at a minum 20 meter to land, giving it plenty of leeway on each side. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, MAA need this so help the people in need in a save way! To do so, we need to combine the datasets as the helicopter's navigation software requires 5 columns (excuse my typing errors) in a specific order, being:\n",
